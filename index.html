        <h2>4. Performance and Stability</h2>

If customization and additional features are vital, AN WhatsApp may appeal to you, but the trade-offs in terms of security and stability could be significant. Conversely, if you prioritize reliability, security, and a user-friendly experience, sticking with the official WhatsApp is the safer option.</p>
